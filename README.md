# Old-TMoaH
My original project I started developing a couple years ago... abandoned due to being unable to figure out how to write files the way I wanted.
A literal mess of code, there's a good reason why I restarted this project almost from scratch. Once I'm done recoding everything it's likely I'll put this project in the attic and forget about it completely.

If you want to play this for some reason, all you need is the TMoaH file and the appropriate CharText file.
